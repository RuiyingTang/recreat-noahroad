        <h2>Reshape your talent into future skills.</h2>
        <p>We help you to become an expert in what the market needs. Companies are looking for people with future skills.
            Frontend development is such a skill. Our tracks make you highly attractive to employers. Ever heard about the
            M-profile? Weâ€™ll work with you on this, by deepening Ã¡nd broadening your expertise. Youâ€™ll invest in a range of
            skills that help you grow and continue growing - in your work and in your personal life. </p>
        <h3>>ðŸ‘‰ LEARN TO WORK. WORK TO LEARN.</h3>
        <p>Youâ€™ll start with 4 months of base training, which you can do alongside your work or studies. This makes it
            easier to take the jump and at the end of it, youâ€™ll land on a solid foundation of skills. </p>
        <h3>ðŸ‘‰ LOOK BACK TO STAY AHEAD.</h3>
        <p>During these 4 months and after, we evaluate together. If this road turns out to not be for you, no worries.
            There are no fines or penalties. We think itâ€™s great you had the guts to try something new. </p>
        <h3>ðŸ‘‰ ON THE ROAD TO DISCOVERY.</h3>
        <p>In the first 4 months, youâ€™ll be working with a real team on real project assignments. Youâ€™ll be supported by
            instructors and graduates. This is your opportunity to discover if this track is something for you. </p>
        <h3>ðŸ‘‰ TAKING THE HIGHWAY.</h3>
        <p>If you want to move forward, youâ€™ll start a paid traineeship at an organization. Youâ€™ll work 4 days a week and
            focus on learning for 1 day. Personal coaching supports you in your new career.</p>
